# Mapping_Earthquakes

##Basil and Sadhana would like to create earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. The module challenge requires to add the tectonic plate location on the map as well as the additional layer to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5. 

###Resources

		Earthquake all week (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) 

		Earthquake M4.5+ (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson)
		
		Tectonic plate data (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json)

- Software: 	   

		Visual Studio Code 1.51.1

		D3.js (https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/5.5.0/d3.js)
		   
		Leaflet (https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.6.0/dist/leaflet.css)
	
###Summary

Deliverable 1: add the tectonic plate data

Deliverable 2: add major earthquake (M4.5+) data with popup display the magnitude and location of the earthquake

Deliverable 3: add an additional map (dark : mapbox://styles/v1/mapbox/dark-v10)
